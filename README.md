# keymap
A guide keymap built with macros in mind!
If you know what to do with the keymap.c file already, just open it up and copy/paste the macros over to your keymap.c file of choice
***This was made for the RoMac Macro Pad, so the keymap.c file will not work on its own with any other keyboards***

//The following material is a guide to using keymap files to go from nothing to your very own firmware!//
